## Who am I?

I am a german VTuber and programmer called RevolverRK (short Rev). I have a total of 8 years worth of experience in programming with 2 years of professional experience. I am mostly self thaught but am currently studying programming in college.

In my free time I like to work on projects for my friends to use. My most recent one being a dnd character sheet hosted on a website of my making and an API for it.
